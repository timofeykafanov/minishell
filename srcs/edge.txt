export sdf
export sdf adasd
export asd=asdasd
export asd="dasd"
export asdas='asdaffs'
export asd="$var" -> expanded var if var is undefined var = empty string
export asdas='$var' -> asdas="\$var"

if export defines a var and tries to expand it in the same command it is not expanded (must be predefined)
if $ is printed in export it needs to have \ in front
