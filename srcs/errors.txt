redirection of heredoc doesnt work example>
./minishell << e
echo test
e

/home/tkafanov/git/minishell$ srcs
/home/tkafanov/git/minishell$ echo 

/home/tkafanov/git/minishell$ echo Hello
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
[1]    1761749 IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./minishell

---

$notexists echo "haha"

echo should be executed (probably parser side)

---

export A="haha         123"
echo $A

space can not follow space in var (it should be "haha 123")

---

"cd -" should move to OPDPWD

---

> ">" or > filename

empty file should be created (probably parser side)

---

/home/tkafanov/git/minishell$ echo Hello | grep H
Hello
/home/tkafanov/git/minishell$ echo Hello |
syntax error near unexpected token `|'
[1]    458265 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./minishell

---

heredoc doesn't redirect

---

heredocs should be executrd untill the syntax error, error shows first (we don't do that, we're not crazy)


---


where I stoped: cd ..$PWD (PWD doesn't expand, wrong exit_status)
